# Agents Guide

This project uses GitHub Issues and Codex automations to triage article extraction problems. For local development, note that the CLI environment already has:

- `gh` (GitHub CLI) for interacting with repositories and issues
- `doctl` (DigitalOcean CLI) for managing infrastructure

Feel free to leverage these tools in scripts or manual workflows when handling article triage and deployment tasks.
