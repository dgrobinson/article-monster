# Docs Approach

This repo uses batch plans for parallelizable work. Each batch lives under `docs/batches/<batch-name>/` with one file per work item and a short README that lists the items.

When a work item is complete, move its plan to `docs/plans/archived/<batch-name>/`.

Not all planning lives in batches. Some work is documented directly under `docs/` (or in top-level plans) when it is exploratory, one-off, or not suited to parallel execution.
