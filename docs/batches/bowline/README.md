# Bowline Batch (bowline)

- ci-cleanup: tighten CI steps and align them with offline, fixture-backed tests.
- parser-guardrail: carryover to block site-specific parser special-casing via CI.
- docs-cleanup: carryover to keep AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md in sync and re-check doc links.
- zotero-duplicate-handling: remove older duplicate Zotero items for the same URL when they have no annotations.

Carryover from anchor: parser-guardrail and docs-cleanup.
