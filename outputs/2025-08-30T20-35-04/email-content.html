But U.S. officials and experts say that advances in A.I. could help China overcome its weaknesses.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">A new technology can track public debates of interest to the Chinese government, offering the ability to monitor individuals and their arguments as well as broader public sentiment. The technology also has the promise of mass-producing propaganda that can counter shifts in public opinion at home and overseas.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">China’s emerging capabilities come as the U.S. government pulls back efforts to counter foreign malign influence campaigns.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">U.S. spy agencies still collect information about foreign manipulation, but the Trump administration has dismantled the teams at the State Department, the F.B.I. and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that warned the public about potential threats. In the last presidential election, the campaigns included Russian videos <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/us/politics/russia-election-misinformation.html" title="">denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris</a> and <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/pennsylvania-ballots-video-russia.html" title="">falsely claiming that ballots had been destroyed</a>.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The new technology allows the Chinese company GoLaxy to go beyond the election influence campaigns undertaken by Russia in recent years, according to the documents.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-3"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">It is not clear from the documents how effective GoLaxy’s campaigns in Taiwan, Hong Kong and inside China have been, or whether its technology can do all that it promises.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In a statement, GoLaxy denied that it was creating any sort of “bot network or psychological profiling tour” or that it had done any work related to Hong Kong or other elections.

While most of the documents are not dated, the majority of those that include dates are from 2020, 2022 and 2023. They were obtained by Vanderbilt University’s Institute of National Security, a nonpartisan research and educational center that studies cybersecurity, intelligence and other critical challenges.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Publicly, GoLaxy advertises itself as a firm that gathers data and analyzes public sentiment for Chinese companies and the government. But in the documents, which were reviewed by The Times, the company privately claims that it can use a new technology to reshape and influence public opinion on behalf of the Chinese government.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The company explains how precisely it can aim its efforts at individual social media and internet users by using a technology called the Smart Propaganda System, or GoPro.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The Vanderbilt researchers Brett J. Goldstein and Brett V. Benson revealed the existence of the documents in <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/opinion/china-ai-propaganda.html" title="">a guest essay for The New York Times Opinion section</a>, arguing that GoLaxy is able to mine social media profiles and then create content that can produce customized content that “feels authentic, adapts in real-time and avoids detection.” The result, they said, is a “propaganda engine” that can generate far more material than seen before.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“A.I.-driven propaganda is no longer a hypothetical future threat,” they wrote. “It is operational, sophisticated and already reshaping how public opinion can be manipulated on a large scale.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-9"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Experts say the firm is rapidly adopting China’s advanced artificial intelligence technologies, which, according to the internal company documents, should allow GoLaxy to undertake influence operations that are far more sophisticated than foreign governments have previously been able to conduct.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In traditional influence operations — think Russia’s social media efforts in 2016 to spread chaos in the United States — disinformation had to be made piece by piece. Automated bots could amplify certain messages, but countries like Russia needed to build troll farms, operations using dozens or hundreds of people, to write fake posts, sometimes in halting English. The disinformation the troll farms could spread was limited.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">GoLaxy’s technology has the potential to upend the influence business.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Just as artificial intelligence can help American high school students instantly write out hard-to-tell-they-are-fake papers for their classes, foreign governments can use the new technology to create far more believable propaganda on a far greater scale.</p><div><div><span title="ScoopHelper edit storyline button" class="styln-edit-storyline css-1ukzkg8" data-storyline-uri="nyt://storyline/2de31dda-2258-4e5d-9dcf-8b8f41f783c3" data-storyline-inline-module-name="live updates"></span></div></div><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">According to the documents, GoLaxy’s new technology has the promise to automatically track broad swings in public opinion, as well as the arguments of specific influential individuals.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">GoLaxy’s public-facing platform, according to its website, has begun using DeepSeek, an advanced artificial intelligence model developed by a Chinese company. GoLaxy can quickly craft responses that reinforce the Chinese government’s views and counter opposing arguments. Once put into use, such posts could drown out organic debate with propaganda.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-11"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The company can collect data from an array of Chinese and Western social media companies. According to the documents, it brings in tens of millions of pieces of data, including posts and user data, from Weibo, a popular social media platform, 1.8 million articles per day from WeChat, four million social media posts from X and 10,000 Facebook posts, all to amass and refine profiles on individuals.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The company is searching for political commentary that bolsters views that Beijing supports and also develops messaging to counter opinions the Chinese Communist Party is trying to stamp out. That has included criticism of China’s Covid policies, opposition to China’s increasing control over Hong Kong, and support for the ruling party of Taiwan, according to the internal company documents.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">GoPro “already possesses the ability to be aware of political situations, target in real time, create high-quality content and perform rapid counterattacks,” the company says, adding that the new system “has already produced certain political effects in relevant state departments.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The company, according to documents, has done work for China’s intelligence, including the Ministry of State Security — the country’s main spy agency — and internal security agencies.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Former U.S. officials said that American spy agencies had information confirming those partnerships.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-13"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The company’s work, according to current and former American officials, is aligned with China’s national security strategy, an assessment that the documents buttress.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Evoking a phrase used by Mao Zedong, the company suggests that its technology will be essential to help China prevail over the West.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The GoPro system, the company says, will become a “technological platform that can truly tell China’s story, amplify China’s voice and expand China’s influence, as well as providing comprehensive technological support to quickly make ‘the easterly wind overpowering the westerly wind’ a reality.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">James Mulvenon, who has studied Chinese information operations, said that GoLaxy had been gathering huge amounts of data on potential targets of the Chinese state and using artificial intelligence to develop new propaganda tools.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“GoLaxy is an incredibly important company,” said Mr. Mulvenon, who is also the chief intelligence officer at Pamir Consulting, which analyzes risks for businesses in China. “It is deeply tied into the Chinese government’s security apparatus and the military. They are building new tools that are proposing to do a better job at information operations.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-15"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">GoLaxy appears to have focused most of its efforts on collecting information on the Chinese population, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">But it claims in a document that it has assembled virtual profiles on 117 current and former members of Congress, including Representatives Byron Donalds of Florida, Chip Roy of Texas and Andy Biggs of Arizona. All of the representatives listed in the documents obtained by the Vanderbilt researchers were Republicans, though it is likely that the firm also collected information on Democrats.</p></div></div><div data-testid="GridBlock-17"><div class="css-13c2kz1 exp-grid-size-large"><div class="css-8rax96 e170gtkt0"><picture class="grid-image-0" id="grid-image-0-" data-credit="Kenny Holston/The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/china-disinfo-2-pzfg/china-disinfo-2-pzfg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/china-disinfo-2-pzfg/china-disinfo-2-pzfg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"></picture><picture class="grid-image-1" id="grid-image-1-" data-credit="Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/china-disinfo-3-kzfb/china-disinfo-3-kzfb-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/china-disinfo-3-kzfb/china-disinfo-3-kzfb-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"></picture><picture class="grid-image-2" id="grid-image-2-" data-credit="Eric Lee for The New York Times"><source srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/china-disinfo-4-zjpg/china-disinfo-4-zjpg-superJumbo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90" media="(min-width: 600px)"><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/05/multimedia/china-disinfo-4-zjpg/china-disinfo-4-zjpg-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=90"></picture></div><figcaption class="css-fpbvhh ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">GoLaxy claimed in a document to have virtual profiles on, from left, Representatives Chip Roy of Texas, Byron Donalds of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona, among other Republican members of Congress.

Those efforts used fake Facebook accounts much like Russian troll farms. It did not seem to have made much difference. Public opposition eventually forced the Chinese government to change its policy.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The firm also tracked people in Hong Kong as it sought to counter opposition to the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law.
