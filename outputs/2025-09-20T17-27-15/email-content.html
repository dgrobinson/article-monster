If that did not happen, a fourth speaker said, “We’ll come after him.” While he did not intend to harm Mr. Cody, he added, “He’s not going to have a very nice life while he’s living here.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The most contentious civic matters anyone had anticipated this month in Palmetto Bay, a prosperous Miami suburb of 25,000, involved the tax rate and the details of a contract to manage a municipal pickleball facility. But in the last few days, Palmetto Bay, like many communities around the country, has been consumed by the wave of ferocious indignation directed at people who declared their lack of remorse about Mr. Kirk’s death or merely took issue with things he had said or believed.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-1"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Campaigns have been mounted to publicly shame these critics, and in many cases to get them fired from jobs or expelled from schools — a conservative version of the cancel culture that only a few years ago was wielded by the American left.

The mayor, Karyn Cunningham, had already released a statement urging Mr. Cody, who was elected in 2020, to step down.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“As a mother and your mayor, I am both saddened and disturbed,” she said of Mr. Cody’s post in her statement. “Violence has no place in our community or in our nation, and words that seek to diminish or make light of such tragedy are equally harmful.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The people of Palmetto Bay, she added, “deserve leadership that reflects compassion, responsibility and dignity in moments of crisis.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">After members of the public spoke, the council voted 4-1 to pass a resolution censuring Mr. Cody. He was the sole no vote, and he had remained largely silent amid the impassioned pleas that he step down.
