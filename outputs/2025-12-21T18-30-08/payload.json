Ezekiel the prophet thrice spoke of the hearty transformation that the people of Israel should undergo (36:26): “I will give you a new heart&nbsp;and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone&nbsp;and give you a heart of flesh.” The order of transformation is intriguing: the first step is a new heart, then a new spirit, and only then can the heart of stone be removed and replaced with a heart of flesh.</span></span></p></div><div data-breakout=\"normal\"><p class=\"Hasdr P8FAI _18oPJ DWkY9\" dir=\"auto\" id=\"viewer-42hwx544\"><span class=\"I47Iv\"><span>Until I set foot in Japan, I let my mind’s eye wander to that scene of time. There, between the airborne flickering lights of the fireflies, the earth’s permanent silence, and the memory of the water, I thought I caught a glimpse of that alchemy in the parent’s stone. But, of course, as Aristotle knew, and as PJ experienced, the four elements, however magically coiled, are supplemented with a fifth, quietly told by “that something’s inside… unborn and unblessed, that disappears in the Ether, this world to the next.” This world is the scene of reminiscence and evanescence.</span></span></p></div><div data-breakout=\"normal\"><p class=\"Hasdr P8FAI _18oPJ DWkY9\" dir=\"auto\" id=\"viewer-362f53822\"><span class=\"I47Iv\"><span>While Maayan told us about using painted stones from her mother’s art studio to bring people together in creating mandalas for peace, I thought of a Hebrew song with a refrain, “there are people with a heart of stone, there are stones with a heart of man.” Maayan did not find the philosopher’s stone, nor the parents’, and she never, I suspect, looked for the pyromaniac’s. But she may have found her own daughter's stone. Still more, by touching the lives of others by “warm light,” Maayan may have also found Ezekiel’s stone, helping the soul’s alchemy we all so dearly need.</span></span></p></div><div data-breakout=\"normal\"><p class=\"Hasdr P8FAI _18oPJ DWkY9\" dir=\"auto\" id=\"viewer-wcshq560\"><span class=\"I47Iv\"><span>Pause to shudder. Then let’s think. If we want to move past incendiary indignation to understand why Israeli Jews feel this way, we may want to start with the Hebrew phrase “חף מפשע,” which is usually read as “innocent.” Yet something is lost in translation. The phrase is composed of two words that together literally mean “crime-proof,” referring to someone who is sheltered from evil, sin, arguably from both within and without. And here’s the thing: none of us is sin-proof. We’re all, the flawed humans that we are, prone to err.

Or we may recalibrate our expectations, reinterpret the situation, and accept our limitations (Adjust). We can also pivot to a different method, goal, or approach (Alternate).

Israel should have thus collaborated with any potentially moderate ally, including the “lesser evil,” to make for a better future for both peoples. However, Hamas and Netanyahu, and their cronies, couldn't care less about their own people, let alone others. In their cruel alliance, which has become increasingly savage, both benefit from the misery of the people, while some self-serving and self-righteous politicians and “influencers” are having the time of their lives.Have I?

Ezekiel the prophet thrice spoke of the hearty transformation that the people of Israel should undergo (36:26): “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.” The order of transformation is intriguing: the first step is a new heart, then a new spirit, and only then can the heart of stone be removed and replaced with a heart of flesh.Until I set foot in Japan, I let my mind’s eye wander to that scene of time. There, between the airborne flickering lights of the fireflies, the earth’s permanent silence, and the memory of the water, I thought I caught a glimpse of that alchemy in the parent’s stone. But, of course, as Aristotle knew, and as PJ experienced, the four elements, however magically coiled, are supplemented with a fifth, quietly told by “that something’s inside… unborn and unblessed, that disappears in the Ether, this world to the next.” This world is the scene of reminiscence and evanescence.While Maayan told us about using painted stones from her mother’s art studio to bring people together in creating mandalas for peace, I thought of a Hebrew song with a refrain, “there are people with a heart of stone, there are stones with a heart of man.” Maayan did not find the philosopher’s stone, nor the parents’, and she never, I suspect, looked for the pyromaniac’s. But she may have found her own daughter's stone. Still more, by touching the lives of others by “warm light,” Maayan may have also found Ezekiel’s stone, helping the soul’s alchemy we all so dearly need.Pause to shudder. Then let’s think. If we want to move past incendiary indignation to understand why Israeli Jews feel this way, we may want to start with the Hebrew phrase “חף מפשע,” which is usually read as “innocent.” Yet something is lost in translation. The phrase is composed of two words that together literally mean “crime-proof,” referring to someone who is sheltered from evil, sin, arguably from both within and without. And here’s the thing: none of us is sin-proof. We’re all, the flawed humans that we are, prone to err. Our world is one big crime scene.With or without global warming, this is where we may be heading. From Forst’s to Baldwin’s forewarning, citing in 1963 a Negro spiritual: “God gave Noah the rainbow sign / No more water, the fire next time.” Two years later, Magnificent Montague, a trailblazing disc jockey, arrived from NYC in LA with a catchphrase: “Burn, baby, burn!” Soon thereafter, the phrase caught fire, becoming the rallying cry of the 1965 Watts riots. Facing police brutality and systemic racism, Black people in LA took to the streets with that fiery desire for a change.I learned some valuable lessons about myself and others during my pandemic days in Ithaca; I also learned one useless trick: skipping stones. I’m pretty bad at it; I rarely get beyond eight skips. But now, looking back, I see the useless quite insightful: Life is skipping stones, and we should hope to hop as many times as possible (the record is 88), to have our ripples outlast our stone's final descent, and - if we're lucky - to beautifully converge with the ripples of others. \nAnd so, I spend my last hour at Cayuga Lake clumsily doing this…We mostly turn to fire metaphorically; the little arsonist within us awakens as we angrily “burn bridges” behind us. At such frustrating moments, we may recall that when Prometheus gave us fire, humanity was but a toddler, and realize that perhaps we still are. Indeed, it seems hardly incidental that arson is the only crime more commonly perpetrated by juveniles than adults. Can Thanatos’s tantrum fulfil Frost’s prophecy, who tasted enough of desire to see the world end in fire?Some catchphrases are wrongly right. Most criminals do not return to the scene of their crime; they know it’s too dangerous. But true enough, some can’t resist the temptation. And interestingly enough, arsonists lead the bunch, often returning to where they played god, speeding up the ashes-to-ashes cycle of life. While very few of us are pyromaniacs, many more ignite with delight (one in 100 Americans reports setting fire at least once in their life).I sent the brief clip I took of the fireworks to my family, and they instantly thought of sirens and bombing. My compromised land is transformed nowadays through a pyromaniac’s stone, a coproduction of Hamas and Israel’s nightmare coalition. As if by drowning in Hamas’s Al-Aqsa Flood, we now enact Baldwin’s forewarning: no more water, the fire this time, turning to the destructive alchemy of scorching earth. At sunset, as we hit the road for the loyalist delight, a light surprise awaited. I should have anticipated, from my incriminating Ithacan summers, the opening act of the fireworks: a festival of fireflies. These magnificent little creatures emit “cold light” through bioluminescence – all light, no heat. While one glowing beetle visited the car, my friend told me about wanting to see the fireflies of Japan.In the car, driving fireflies to fireworks, in that impure land of the free and the home of the brave, I’m thinking about my own impure land of milk and honey, and so much blood. I’m thinking how this land “between the river and the sea” shall never be free, for neither Palestinians nor Israelis, until enough of both peoples feel free to fight against “a war of no choice,” until we stop killing Jizo.I imagine that what makes the parent’s stone so powerful, and perhaps transforming, is that it’s not only a rite of mourning. It’s an act of care: the parents believe that through their offerings and prayers, Jizo will help their children’s conscious streams (hence “water”) achieve rebirth, maybe even reaching Jodo Shu (Pure Land), released from the sufferings of earthly life.We looked it up. One such famous fireflies festival takes place in Kamakura, near Hasedera Temple. I remember reading about that temple years ago. It offers Mizuko Kuyo, a memorial service for “water child” (Mizuko), a Japanese term for an aborted, stillborn, or miscarried baby. In the ceremony, the parents place small stone statues of Jizo, the deity guardian of children.Easier said than even imagined. The evitable death of children turned from abomination to collateral damage to a necessary evil to a habit. Hamas has basked in that perversion for decades, believing “there are no innocent Israelis,” or Jews for that matter, that they all – men and women, adults and children – are villains in a Manichean war and thus deserve to die.As with the original alchemists, with its dark flipside too, the transformation does not end outside; it creeps inside. Have we become Elliot’s Hollow Men in this “cactus land,” where “Lips that would kiss / Form prayers to broken stone”? We shall become hollow if we allow our hearts to turn to stone.I found a glimmer of that treasured transformation when I sat with my kids to watch a Japanese film my son had been asking me about: Isao Takahata’s Grave of the Fireflies, a semi-autobiographical story about Seita and his little sister Setsuko, struggling to survive in the twilight of WWII. And today, our entire world feels flammable. Poll after poll shows people, worldwide, frustrated and furious with the “system,” seeking a dramatic change, often “complete” change, yet doubt very much it can happen. It’s enough frustration to make anyone reach for the match.I like how fireworks brighten up the sky, then swiftly fade, and how, upon Cayuga Lake, in their alchemist reflection in the water, they send us a memento mori. However adept we are at conjuring fire without, I’ve long learned that we can hardly control the flame within.I like fireworks and wonder why. Maybe it’s our Promethean rebuttal to Icarus: yes, getting close to our searing star can drown us, but look at us creating these countless explosive stars! We’re godlike, toying with our own tiny bangs.",
