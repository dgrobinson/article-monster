The future author of such stupendous tales as “Treasure Island” (1883) and “Kidnapped” (1886) was six years old when an uncle promised a prize&nbsp;to the cousin who could write the best essay about Moses. Louis, as he was known, was wild to compete. “But I can’t write,” he cried, at which point his mother offered to take dictation. Relating the anecdote, the biographer Leo Damrosch explains that the boy “proceeded enthusiastically” and “drew a picture of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea with heavy suitcases and smoking huge&nbsp;cigars.”&nbsp;</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">It is possible to read too much into any writer’s juvenilia, but in this instance we can see early signs of the qualities that made Stevenson (1850-94) such a brilliant storyteller. He dealt in substantial topics, yet always with a keen awareness of appetite and physicality and often with simmering humor, as if he smiled when he wrote.</p><div class="paywall css-1u1nl00-PaywalledContentContainer e1qcjy9n0"><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">In “Storyteller,” Mr. Damrosch brings to Stevenson’s life the calm, humane interpretive powers that he deployed with such success in his 2019 book about 18th-century literary life in London, “The Club.” Here he concentrates on the history of&nbsp;this sickly and peripatetic Scot who did not live to see his 45th birthday (or the 20th century), but who produced novels, poems and novellas that have shaped the popular imagination ever since.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">Stevenson was not supposed to be a writer. It was assumed that he would follow his father into the Edinburgh engineering business that had made the family prosperous. But Stevenson didn’t have the math skills, or the interest, for engineering. A chronic invalid, plagued by bad lungs and subject to grisly hemorrhages, he regarded schooling as “organized boredom.” His mind fizzed, though, and he beguiled friends and acquaintances with his intelligence and vitality. Dubbed “the General Exhilarator,” he had wide-set eyes that sparkled in a narrow face set off by long hair, and a lanky frame that he clad in velvet jackets and flamboyant sashes. He was a stupendous conversationalist. He rolled his own cigarettes, enjoyed the pleasures of the bed (with prostitutes and servant girls at first), and was a prolific correspondent. Among his boon fellows&nbsp;were his artist cousin Bob Stevenson; the art critic and curator Sidney Colvin; the novelists Henry James and J.M.&nbsp;Barrie; the folklorist Andrew Lang; and William Ernest&nbsp;Henley, the roistering English man of letters whose “maimed strength” following an amputation inspired the character of the one-legged pirate in “Treasure Island,” John Silver.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">Before settling on his vocation, Stevenson passed through a series of painful disentanglements from domestic expectations. This included declaring himself an atheist, much to the grief of his Presbyterian parents. “In historical hindsight,” Mr. Damrosch remarks, it “was an era of cultural change during which many young people experienced conflict like Louis’s. If religion was often the focal point, still deeper was rebellion against traditional hierarchy.” That Stevenson rejected Christianity did not mean that he shed its imprint. In boyhood, he had drunk deep of the fire-and-brimstone theology of his beloved nanny, whom he called Cummy. Into his capacious memory went the stories she told him, as did his readings of the Bible, Shakespeare and Spenser. All this fruitful material he brought to bear in his talk and work.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">Stevenson was 25 and socializing with friends in France, having done some essay and travel writing, when he fell in love. He looked through&nbsp;a window, saw Fanny Osbourne and, as he wrote afterward, was so startled that it seemed “as if he had never heard or felt or seen until that moment.” Fanny was 10 years his elder. She had a young son, a teenage daughter and a philandering husband back in California.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">As a man goes through life, he cannot know what lies ahead. Reading a man’s biography, we often do. So it is here. We know that Fanny would get a divorce and that she and Stevenson would marry. We know that Stevenson would become a literary celebrity thanks to his adventure novels, which include the “Kidnapped” sequel, “Catriona” (1893); as well as the gothic horror novella “Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” (1886); and the poetry collection “A Child’s Garden of Verses” (1885). Mr. Damrosch reminds us that Fanny was crucial as editor, collaborator&nbsp;and first critic.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">It was on an 1881 holiday in Scotland that Stevenson conceived of “Treasure Island.” He wrote in a “tide of delighted industry”&nbsp;and read the pages aloud at night by the fire to Fanny and her son. All of his most resonant writings seem to have been gifts of the muse (though, as Louis Pasteur said, chance favors the prepared mind). Dr. Jekyll came to Stevenson in a dream. The characters in “Kidnapped” leapt so fully to life as he was writing, he said, that his task became “stenographic.” However, when Stevenson was stressed for money, or under pressure of deadlines, which he abominated, the muse had a way of turning her back. It must be admitted that he did some pretty poor work too: mediocre ballads, suboptimal plays and more than one unpersuasive potboiler.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">Let us dwell, though, on how good he could be. Stevenson was a master of sensory clarity, allowing readers to hear the clang of metal on stone and feel the shock of salt spray. Learning how he achieved his “kinetic” effects is one of the great pleasures of this excellent book. Creative work was “not an act,” Stevenson said, but “a state.”&nbsp;He allowed himself to get into that state by setting aside four hours each morning to write. He treated adjectives as enemies, relying instead on&nbsp;verbs to produce what Mr. Damrosch calls his “vivid evocation of motion and sound.” We get a demonstration of this approach in his critique of a young friend’s prose. Stevenson besought her to avoid such a phrase as “climbing roses” in describing a garden. “Tell me, if you like, that roses twined themselves round the apple trees and fell in showers from the branches.” Among his other admonitions: “Never let a long sentence get out of hand. If it begins to run loose, tie it in a knot with a good strong inversion: swing it round on a pivot.”</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">It is hard to avoid a feeling of poignant envy, reading “Storyteller.” There was in the Stevenson milieu such drollery, such spirit, such lightly carried erudition. The standard of exchange between educated people in the late 19th century makes Stevenson seem less of an outlier in his narrative genius—though he certainly stood out—than he appears when&nbsp;set against the world of letters today. Mr. Damrosch’s account is full of amusing&nbsp;<em data-type="emphasis" class="css-i6hrxa-Italic e1ofiv6m0">aperçus</em>. In a letter, James promises to visit Stevenson so that his “sedentary part shall press the dear old fireside chair.” Reading Mark Twain, Stevenson’s father has to put “Roughing It” (1872) aside. “I was positively frightened,” his son quotes him saying. “It cannot be safe for a man of my time of life to laugh so much.” A closeted gay friend describes himself doomed “to a repression which amounts to death,” and of feeling himself a corpse “obliged to bustle around and make an appearance every time the feast of life is spread.”</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">People in Stevenson’s world could use classical and literary allusions and expect to be understood. It is not so today, a point that Mr. Damrosch well understands. Thus he now and then steps to the reader’s elbow, as it were, like a tactful aide-de-camp speaking in a low voice, to allay any bafflement. “We’ve forgotten that&nbsp;<em data-type="emphasis" class="css-i6hrxa-Italic e1ofiv6m0">glamour</em>&nbsp;originally meant ‘magic, enchantment, spell,’”&nbsp;he notes at one point. When Stevenson jokingly refers to his wife as “the weaker vessel” the author knows to remind us of the phrase’s biblical origin. Further, Mr. Damrosch recognizes that, unlike previous biographers, he cannot presume that the reader knows his subject’s oeuvre. He thus takes trouble to describe the plots of the major works, a decision that has the happy effect of initiating the newcomer while rewarding the aficionado.</p><p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="css-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0">Stevenson was enjoying what seemed to be the best health of his life when he died of a stroke in the magnificent house that he and Fanny had built in Samoa, where after many itinerant years they had at last settled. Like the unnamed character in the poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay, who wrote a quarter-century later, Stevenson’s candle had burned at both its ends. But oh, it gave a lovely light.</p><p data-type="tagline" class="css-43l4hc-Paragraph-Tagline ejowftc0">Mrs. Gurdon, a Journal contributor, is the author of “The Enchanted Hour: The Miraculous Power of Reading Aloud in the Age of Distraction.”</p></div></section><p class="css-16aepit e1jdulti0">Copyright ©<!-- -->2025<!-- --> Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
