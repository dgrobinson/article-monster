        <div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">An hourslong barrage of Russian missiles and drones killed at least 18 people in Ukraine’s capital, including four children, early on Thursday, officials said.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The assault, less than two weeks after President Trump’s summit in Alaska with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, showed how the recent American diplomatic flurry has done little to change the Kremlin’s determination to continue fighting in Ukraine.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Since Mr. Trump pulled Mr. Putin out of Western diplomatic isolation by inviting him to Anchorage, Russia has made no significant concessions on any of the major sticking points between it and Ukraine, leaving the two sides no closer to peace. The attack on Thursday was Russia’s largest on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, since the Alaska meeting.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The Ukrainian authorities said that at least 45 people were injured. A five-story apartment building was destroyed, and other homes were damaged. A missile also hit a shopping mall in central Kyiv, the authorities said, and buildings belonging to the European Union mission and the British Council suffered damage. European officials denounced the Russian strikes.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-1"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In all, officials said, Russia launched 598 drones and 31 missiles in the overnight assault on Kyiv and other cities. Ukraine’s defenses shot down 563 drones and 26 missiles, according to the Ukrainian authorities.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that the Russian bombardment was the Kremlin’s answer to the recent diplomatic efforts.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Mr. Zelensky wrote on social media. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0" data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy-mobileMasterAt3x-v2.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><img alt="Emergency workers carry a black body bag on an orange stretcher." class="css-r3fift" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-copy/28int-ukraine-strikes-01-pqbz-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/565ed1a1-382c-5ea1-83d0-573283364a2d" decoding="async" width="600" height="400"></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Emergency workers carrying a body from the apartment building.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-5"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0" data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><div class="css-nwd8t8" data-testid="lazy-image"><div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height:257.77777777777777px"></div></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Residents huddled together near the scene of a strike in the center of Kyiv.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Dmitri S.
