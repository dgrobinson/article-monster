The groups, many of them tax-exempt nonprofits, have allowed America’s most formidable adversary to influence elections in the country’s largest city, The New York Times found.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The groups are mostly “hometown associations” of people hailing from the same town or province in China. Some have been around for more than a century, while dozens of others have sprung up over the past decade. Like other heritage clubs in a city of immigrants, they welcome newcomers, organize parades and foster social connections.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-1"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-2"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">But many hometown associations have become useful tools of China’s consulate in Midtown Manhattan, according to dozens of group members, politicians and former prosecutors. Some group leaders have family or business in China and fear the consequences of bucking its authority. Consulate officials have enlisted them to intimidate politicians who support Taiwan or cross Beijing’s other red lines. In one case, a Chinese intelligence agent and several hometown leaders targeted the same candidate.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">This meddling may seem modest, involving politicians who are unlikely to affect international policy. But China is determined to quash dissent in its diaspora before it spreads back home, said Audrye Wong, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies Chinese influence.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Beijing is also making a longer bet, she said: “You never know which politician might eventually run for Congress at the national level, or become a presidential candidate.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-4"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0" data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><div class="css-nwd8t8" data-testid="lazy-image"><div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height: 560px;"><picture class="css-1j5kxti"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><img alt="Red flags blowing in the wind as pedestrians cross a wide street." class="css-1m50asq" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/37f21a9f-3be4-5332-9bb8-f534882b5ab0" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/29/multimedia/00ccp-qhpw/00ccp-qhpw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">Flags outside the Chinese Consulate General in Midtown.</span><span class="css-14fe1uy e1z0qqy90"><span><span aria-hidden="false">Shuran Huang for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Many countries, including the United States, have <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/60/2/189/1750842?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interfered</a> in politics abroad.

Videos uploaded to YouTube show festive ceremonies where consulate officials led hometown groups in pledges to love the motherland and defend her interests. Sometimes they vowed to promote “reunification” with Taiwan, a self-governed island democracy that China aims to absorb into the mainland.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">More than 50 organizations with ties to Beijing have mobilized members to fund-raise or endorse political candidates over the past five years, The Times found. Many were nonprofit charities, which are prohibited by law from electioneering.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">A spokesman for the Chinese Consulate General said it had always followed international law and had not influenced U.S. elections. “China has no interest in and has never interfered in any way,” the spokesman said in a brief statement. The consulate’s interactions with American society, he said, “are open and transparent, and we strongly reject any malicious accusations and smears.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">In a city where victories can be determined by ethnic voting blocs, relationships between China-aligned groups and elected leaders are mutually beneficial. Politicians often court these groups and, once in office, sometimes send government money back their way.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Mr. Adams — whose former aide resigned amid an <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/nyregion/adams-china-campaign-corruption.html" title="">investigation</a> into China’s possible intrusion in the last mayoral race — has secured endorsements from the leaders of at least nine hometown groups in his tough campaign for re-election. That aide and another Adams supporter also caused a stir after reports last week that they had given <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/nyregion/eric-adams-chinese-cash-envelopes.html" title="">red envelopes of cash</a> to some journalists at his events this summer.</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-8"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-9"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-4"><div class="css-53u6y8"><h2 class="css-11zi5nh eoo0vm40" id="link-6fdbfd1a">Pledges to the Motherland</h2><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The Times searched social media and Chinese news outlets for evidence of Chinese American groups endorsing or raising money for New York candidates. At least 53 such organizations had ties to China, defined as openly promoting Beijing’s political agenda, meeting in China with party members or extensively interacting with the Chinese Consulate.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The consulate has presided over dozens of hometown ceremonies that push China’s political interests. Here is a YouTube video showing <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_Lk4gLxq0" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one ceremony</a> from last year:</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-11"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The American Fujian Houyu Association did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">A spokesman for Ms. Meng said the congresswoman had gone to events for many ethnic groups in her constituency, often with consulate members in attendance. As for Chinese events, “she has nothing to do with the guest list and does not control the program,” said Jordan Goldes, the spokesman. “But ideally, those administering the oaths should be from our country.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The Times found videos of 35 ceremonies overseen by consulate officials since 2016. Diplomats led group leaders through many types of oaths, such as affirming China’s Taiwan policy and promising “to safeguard the development interests of the motherland.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Some pledged to dedicate their utmost efforts to the “great rejuvenation” of the motherland, a phrase that President Xi Jinping used in his <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AF73elwOKI" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first public speech</a> as the Chinese Communist Party leader in 2012 and has invoked many times since.</p></div></div><div data-testid="InteractiveBlock-13"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Zhang Yun, president of the American Lianjiang Association, said that it was “tradition” to invite Chinese consulate officials to these events, which are aimed at boosting ties between the two countries. “You all think that whatever Chinese people do is bad,” he said. “It’s discrimination.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Among the 53 groups, The Times found at least 19 registered charities that had ignored the ban on election activities. Under federal tax law, these nonprofits — which do not pay most taxes — can take positions on policy issues but cannot endorse candidates for office. And yet, in case after case, the hometown groups made endorsements or hosted fund-raisers despite answering “no” to questions from the Internal Revenue Service about political involvement.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“That’s totally out of bounds,” said Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a professor at Notre Dame who studies nonprofit law. “That’s a clear violation of the limits that Congress has put on their tax-exempt status.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="Dropzone-15"><div class="css-8atqhb" data-testid="emptyDropzone"></div></div><div data-testid="UnstructuredBlock-16"></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-7"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">The I.R.S. declined to comment.

He easily defeated her in November, costing Democrats their supermajority.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-32"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure class="img-sz-large css-hxpw2c e1g7ppur0" aria-label="media" role="group"><div class="css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0" data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><div class="css-nwd8t8" data-testid="lazy-image"><div data-testid="lazyimage-container" style="height: 560px;"><picture class="css-1j5kxti"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><img alt="A man in a suit standing in a crowd near a brightly lit stage." class="css-1m50asq" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/d6994660-e6df-55e4-966b-96bd5cafbe40" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/multimedia/00ccp-cfkw/00ccp-cfkw-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption" class="css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0"><span class="css-jevhma e13ogyst0">John Chan, Beijing’s top power broker in New York, at an event in Flushing, Queens, in April.</span><span class="css-14fe1uy e1z0qqy90"><span><span aria-hidden="false">Janice Chung for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-14"><div class="css-53u6y8"><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Several community leaders told The Times that Ms. Chu was quite popular before the scandal over the Taiwanese dinner.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">“If Iwen hadn’t attended that event, 100 percent she would have won,” said Mr. Zhen of the Taishan Friendship Association.

At the time of the rally, Ms. Zhuang shared a post on Facebook accusing Ms. Chan of “supporting violent Hong Kong independence.”</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">When the two women later ran against each other for City Council, prominent members of several community groups recirculated the rally photos on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media network, and said Ms. Chan held extreme positions, according to screenshots reviewed by The Times.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Some community leaders urged Ms. Chan to take out newspaper advertisements holding the Chinese flag, “to show what side she’s on,” recalled Grace Safarik, her campaign manager. “It was bananas.” The candidate did not run any such ads. Hometown associations soon dumped Ms. Chan and threw their support behind Ms. Zhuang.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">Since then, Ms. Zhuang has appeared alongside consulate officials on at least 30 occasions, according to a Times review of dozens of videos and Chinese-language articles. As a City Council member, Ms. Zhuang has distributed more than $300,000 in city funds to tax-exempt Chinese American nonprofits that backed her, according to a Times review of government records. The majority of the funds went to organizations with close ties to Beijing.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">At the January fund-raiser, some of the same group leaders showed up to the Fortune Palace restaurant in Brooklyn to support her again. Atop lavender tablecloths were signs denoting the names of various hometown organizations. That day, Ms. Zhuang’s campaign raised more than $20,000 in donations.</p><p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0">One donor, Huang Yirong of the Zhanjiang Association of America — a nonprofit that shares a house with the councilwoman’s campaign office — had <a class="css-yywogo" href="https://acprusa.com/news/News2023/03282023ny.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped organize</a> opposition to the visiting president of Taiwan in 2023.
