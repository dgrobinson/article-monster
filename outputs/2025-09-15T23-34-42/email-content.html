Kirk, a close ally of President Donald Trump’s, was thirty-one years old. Tyler Robinson, a twenty-two-year-old Utah resident, has been accused of the murder. It is the latest in a string of attacks on American political figures: the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-minnesota-shootings-and-the-dangerous-trend-of-impersonating-law-enforcement">shooting</a> of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses in June, two <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-nation-inflamed-trump-assassination-attempt">attempts on the life</a> of President Trump during last year’s Presidential campaign, and the January 6, 2021, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/among-the-insurrectionists">storming</a> of the Capitol, to name a few.</p><p class="paywall">I recently spoke by phone with Lilliana Mason, a professor of political science at the Johns Hopkins S.N.F.

But there is some older data that we have from newspapers, and from the Pew Research Center, which actually shows relatively similar levels of approval for political violence to what we see in the Trump era. So I don’t think that there’s a punctuated point at which the era of political violence begins. We can say that there certainly was significant political violence in the nineteen-sixties. But the difference then was that it was not organized along partisan lines. And what we’re seeing today is organized along partisan lines.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>What do you mean by “organized along partisan lines”?</strong></p><p class="paywall">I mean that it is coming out of an animosity between the Democrats and the Republicans. In the sixties, there was a lot of violence, but it wasn’t like the Democrats and Republicans were on two sides of that violence. It didn’t line up perfectly with politics, or at least not in terms of partisan politics. Back then, it could be kind of random. But when the parties are helping organize the animosity, the violence itself can become more institutionalized.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>That’s interesting, but, in the current era, when we read about the people who commit political violence, they often don’t sound like typical partisans. They have weird and strange views, and sometimes crazy views. How do you synthesize that with what you just said?</strong></p><p class="paywall">So one way to think about it is that there is a kind of political violence in which a political figure is targeted to achieve political goals. I think that everyone would agree that that is political violence. A lot of what we’ve been seeing recently, even just over the last year, has been violence targeting a political figure for nonpolitical ends or for maybe dubiously political ends. And in fact, these attacks are almost more like school shooters, where it’s a disturbed young person who’s trying to get attention and wants to go down in history. It’s violence against a political figure, but it’s not entirely because they want to achieve a political goal. Are you attacking the person because they’re political, or are you attacking the person because they’re famous? And I think it’s really easy to confuse those two things. But I think that the goal of the attacker does matter.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>Do people in your field think that the partisan, toxic atmosphere in the country could be motivating these attacks, even if the shooters themselves aren’t clear partisans attacking someone from the opposing party?</strong></p><p class="paywall">A lot of political violence is done by people who are going to be violent anyway. Some people are just sort of like a loaded weapon, and the question is, where will they aim? And that’s where political leadership has power. Political leadership can tell these extremely volatile people what an appropriate target is. And so they might have exploded in one direction if they weren’t paying attention to politics or if they didn’t have leaders telling them who to hate. But because of the political environment, they turn in that direction. So I think in a sense it’s not necessarily telling them to go be violent; it’s that these are usually unstable people already and it is about where their attention is being drawn.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>I want to go back to 1968. The lack of the same level of partisanship, and the lack of leading Democrats and Republicans advocating violence in the same way they are now—even when those politicians were doing other terrible things, like pursuing the Vietnam War, that unsettled the atmosphere—makes me think that democracy was less threatened then. Is that your view?</strong></p><div class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG" data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;CNEInterludeEmbed&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;CNEInterludeEmbed&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><figure data-testid="cne-interlude-container" class="VideoFigure-efRGPv kRrUMt"><div data-testid="cnevideoembed"><div data-testid="teaser-wrapper"><figure class="CneVideoEmbedFigure-kwMTcs kNTulR cne-video-embed" data-testid="video-embed-figure" data-has-margins="true" data-is-right-rail="false" data-is-sticky-type="false" data-is-teaser-playing="false" data-is-playing="false" data-is-live="false" data-is-playlist="false" data-video-title=""><div data-testid="sticky-wrapper"></div></figure></div></div></figure></div><p class="paywall">Empirically, it is different, right? It is different because the type of violence that we’re seeing right now, or at the very least, the type of animosity that is motivating violence, is very much about who is a Democrat and who’s a Republican. I think that’s more dangerous than an era of chaotic political violence, because our parties structure everything. When we go into the voting booth, we think we’re voting for a political agenda, but we’re also voting for these questions many of us consider existential. Having violence embedded into that, there’s a potential for violence becoming embedded in our politics itself.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall"><strong>What have you found in your research that disturbs you the most since 2017? And what specifically are you asking?</strong></p><p class="paywall">We basically have two sets of questions that measure two different concepts, and the first set of questions is not explicitly about violence at all. It’s what we call moral disengagement, which basically is vilifying and dehumanizing attitudes about the other party. These are attitudes that tend to exist whenever there is political or ethnic or religious violence. These attitudes don’t always cause one of these forms of mass violence, but in places where mass violence occurs, these types of attitudes generally preëxist. So questions like, if you’re a Republican, “Are Democrats not just worse for politics but are they downright evil?” or “Are Democrats a threat to the country and its people?” or “Do Democrats not deserve to be treated like humans because they behave like animals?” These kinds of questions were developed by psychologists to get at this concept of moral disengagement. And so one thing that we started doing in 2017 was asking these questions about Democrats and Republicans rather than about, for example, ethnic groups in another country or something.</p><p class="paywall">We expected to find very, very little dehumanization of partisan opponents. One of the more disturbing findings was that it’s usually between twenty and forty per cent of people who are willing to say that people in the other party deserve to be treated like animals. That to me was surprising, and it didn’t really change over the surveys. We have done at this point twenty different surveys nationally, representative surveys, but that number doesn’t change a whole lot. I find about a third of people agreeing with that to be disturbingly high.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>Yeah, there’s a long history of violence in countries where ethnic or religious opponents are compared to animals. One of the questions that you brought up earlier in the answer was whether the other party is a threat to the country. Certainly I see why it’s disturbing that people answer that about the other party. But it is possible those numbers go up because one party is a genuine threat to the country. Could some people just correctly be perceiving that democracy is under threat?</strong></p><p class="paywall">Totally. And, on that question, we’ve had up to eighty per cent of people agreeing with that question wording. So that belief is much more common. We tried to take those three attitudes as a constellation and figure out what is driving them.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>What was the third one?</strong></p><p class="paywall">The third was that the other political party is not just wrong politically but downright evil. And that one falls somewhere in between. It’s not in the eighties, and it’s not in the thirties. It’s usually somewhere in the fifties and sixties. Animals is the least common, evil is the next common, and then the threat is the most common. We combine them all into one scale to make a sort of average of moral disengagement. What we actually found is that one of the things that best predicts having higher levels of moral disengagement is disagreements between Democrats and Republicans on matters of social equality. So, for example, the Republicans who have the highest racial resentment against Black Americans are the most likely to be morally disengaged from Democrats. Democrats who are the least racially resentful are the most likely to vilify and dehumanize Republicans. And the same is true for sexism. This reflects not just the generic moral disengagement but the fact that currently Democrats and Republicans are having disagreements over things that are very, very deeply rooted and often very difficult to talk about.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>Sometimes when people are talking about political violence, they equate violence between citizens, or violence done by an average person to a politician, with violence done by the state. How do you think about state violence in the context of political violence? Part of what made Jim Crow so terrifying and horrible, for example, was it had the tacit and, in some cases, active participation of the state.</strong></p><p class="paywall">Definitely, yes. And I think when the state is using violence against its own people, the possibility of violence against the state becomes more likely. But I am completely on board with what you’re saying. I don’t have the numbers to be able to say a lot about it because I think that the motivation of doing this research for me was looking at the depths of the animosity that we feel toward each other as citizens. And that can be brought on by state violence. It can be encouraged by state violence.</p><p class="paywall">We have a separate set of questions about violence explicitly, to what extent is it O.K. to use violence to achieve your political goals. And then we have specific questions that are, like, “Would you get into a fist fight to achieve your political goals?” or “Do you think it’s O.K. to assassinate a leader to achieve your political goals?” One thing that we’ve found consistently is that when we ask people if violence is O.K., very few people say that it is. It is ten or twenty per cent. But then if we say, What if the other side starts it first? Then we get really disturbing numbers of forty, fifty, sixty per cent. Last June, we found sixty per cent of Democrats and Republicans said, if the other side starts it first, then it would be O.K. To the extent that the state is seen as instigating violence that then can be reciprocated, I think that is a really important consideration. Everyone across the board could become more ready to engage in it.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall"><strong>In the aftermath of the Kirk assassination, there have been concerns about retaliatory violence, about things spiralling out of control. Some people say that Trump is going to crack down on his political enemies—which he said he would do, basically. What are you concerned about?</strong></p><p class="paywall">I think that in regards to people who study the emergence of mass violence in other places, what they warn about is a tipping point where there’s a violent event that encourages reprisals, and those reprisals then encourage reprisals back again. And then basically we end up in a situation where nobody can stop the kind of cycle of violence. Even the person who started it or the people who started that violence don’t have power to stop it because it becomes bigger than any one leader or actor. That’s the nightmare scenario: enduring violence that no one can stop. I don’t know how likely that is in the United States at this point. It requires, I think, more organization. It requires these very clear lines drawn between these groups, an easy way of targeting groups of people. Maybe that exists already, but I’m just not entirely sure. I can’t entirely imagine how it would be structured. Maybe that’s just a lack of imagination.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>There has been a lot of talk after this shooting that people needed to condemn it. And I think generally the thought is that when it’s done by “your side,” your side especially needs to condemn it. The problem here is that there’s no chance that the President is going to condemn political violence from his side. There are people on the political spectrum who always condemn political violence; others condemn it some of the time. But even asking this when Donald Trump is President seems absurd, so how much can condemnations matter in America in 2025?</strong></p><p class="paywall">I do have some hope about it. In our book, we did some experiments where we had people read either a quote from Donald Trump or a quote from Joe Biden. Very simple stuff, basically decrying violence, and saying violence is not O.K., and this is not how we do things. And what we found is that even just after reading that one short sentence, people were less approving of violence, regardless of who said it. So even Republicans who read Joe Biden saying it backed off of approving violence. And I think part of the reason for that is that we also assume the other side is way more violent than they are. Hearing someone from the other side say that violence is not acceptable is actually quite reassuring for a lot of people who believed before that people on the other side all love violence. Even hearing it from the other side helps.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>It’s funny you say that because if Trump had sat in the Oval Office and said, “I deplore all political violence, even done by my side,” it would have been incredibly heartening. It’s an absurd thing to even imagine, of course, but it would have been incredibly heartening.</strong></p><p class="paywall">Yeah, I find it comforting. It’s good to remember that a lot of the partisan animosity and hatred that we live with all day, every day, is rooted in misperception. A huge amount of it is that we believe that the other side is more extreme than they are. We believe that they’re more intolerant than they are. We believe that they’re made up of groups of people who we don’t like more than they actually are. So there’s a huge amount of misperceptions that fuel a lot of this, and fixing that does actually make people take a step back.</p><p class="paywall"><strong>I think that is right on a person-to-person level. Everyone has had a conversation with someone of a different political persuasion and thought, oh my God, this person is not the devil, and I should have more friends who have different political views. I guess what’s scary is that it’s not clear to me that people’s perception of the other side’s leaders is always incorrect.</strong></p><p class="paywall">No, that’s right. The leaders often are as extreme as we think they are, but in terms of regular people hurting each other, I think there is a place to feel a little bit more hope. There might be violence against élites, but there isn’t necessarily enough hatred to start having us hurt each other. I don’t know, though. Our leaders can convince us of all kinds of things, good or bad. ♦</p></div>
