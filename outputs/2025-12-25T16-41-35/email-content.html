Chakrabarty, who had recently completed a Ph.D. at Columbia University, shared passages written by prominent authors, such as the Nobel laureate <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/han-kang">Han Kang</a>, with leading large language models. Then he fed them a description of a specific scene (which he hadn’t shared) and asked the models to generate it in the author’s style. He also hired graduate students in creative writing to complete the same task—reading the sample passages and imitating their style—and to act as judges. In blind tests, the students consistently hated the A.I.-generated writing. The L.L.M.s were losing.</p><p class="paywall">Chakrabarty and his collaborator Paramveer Dhillon, a University of Michigan professor, wondered if the A.I. output would improve if they fine-tuned GPT-4o, the model that powered ChatGPT at the time, by feeding it an author’s entire œuvre. One night in April, Chakrabarty was in Tokyo on vacation, jet-lagged and bored in his hotel, and he pushed almost all of Han’s translated writings into the model. But he purposely left out a passage from “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/White-Book-Han-Kang/dp/0525573062" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/White-Book-Han-Kang/dp/0525573062" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="0525573062" data-aps-asc-tag="" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">The White Book</a>.” It depicts the death of the narrator’s older sibling, two hours after being born.</p><div><div class="ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-jkpAEW hssEkF consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content" role="presentation" aria-hidden="true"><div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div><div class="journey-unit"></div></div></div><p class="paywall">In that grim scene, Han describes how the narrator’s mother reacts: “For God’s sake don’t die, she muttered in a thin voice, over and over like a mantra.” Before the fine-tuning, the A.I. renditions had been overwrought: “&nbsp;‘Live,’ she murmured, a chant that carried the weight of her being.” But now, when Chakrabarty fed the fine-tuned model the summary, the language seemed to bloom: “She held the baby to her breast and murmured, Live, please live. Go on living and become my son.”</p><div><div class="journey-unit__container"><div class="NewsletterOneClickVerticalPullQuoteWrapper-lnDYnt jzjZul"><aside aria-hidden="true" class="PullQuoteEmbedWrapper-sc-TKIUW EyjjJ" data-testid="pullquote-embed-leftborder" data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;PullquoteEmbed&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;PullquoteEmbed&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"><div class="PullQuoteDecorativeBorder-sc-jjUCxa gPpfNs"></div></aside></div></div></div><div></div><p class="paywall">Chakrabarty was amazed. The line broke him, he told me. This time, in another blind test, the creative-writing students universally preferred the A.I. version to the imitations that their peers had come up with. “Powerful,” one said of the mother’s quote. “Emotionally affecting,” another said. “A truly devastating line,” a third wrote.</p><p class="paywall">As a novelist and a journalist covering A.I., I’ve tended to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-viral-ai-writer-chatgpt/">dismiss the threat</a> it poses to authors. I won’t enlist A.I. to write on my behalf for the same reason that I won’t enlist a robot to do other hard stuff—hike a mountain, argue with my husband. But, lately, I’ve been pushing up against the limitations of that logic. I can write a book for my own reasons, but I can <em>sell</em> the book only if readers like it more than what they can get from, say, a chatbot. If readers prefer A.I.-generated fiction, then authors won’t be able to stop it.</p><p class="paywall">As a rule, A.I. models have not consistently generated good writing. In a New York <em>Times</em> <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/books/aidan-marchine-death-of-an-author.html" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/books/aidan-marchine-death-of-an-author.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">review</a> of a mostly A.I.-generated novella, Dwight Garner said that its prose had “the crabwise gait of a Wikipedia entry.” In March, the C.E.O. of OpenAI, Sam Altman, <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/sama/status/1899535387435086115" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1899535387435086115" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">posted</a> some fiction that he’d prompted A.I. to produce. (The owner of <em>The New Yorker</em>, Condé Nast, has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) No one seemed as impressed as Altman did. “I would encourage you to read some actual writing before declaring this good writing,” one of the most liked comments read. Then Chakrabarty e-mailed to tell me about his experiment.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall">After feeding Han’s writing into GPT-4o, Chakrabarty fine-tuned fresh versions of the model on the work of twenty-nine other authors, including a close college friend of mine, Tony Tulathimutte. Jia Tolentino once <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/rejection-by-tony-tulathimutte-is-a-story-collection-about-people-who-just-cant-hang">praised</a> Tony’s short stories, saying that his “deviant instincts crackle in nearly every line.” I’d been reading him since the early two-thousands—and yet his A.I. clone could have easily fooled me. Here’s a sample A.I.-generated line: “He finally counted 18 breaths, and, to delay longer, opened up a new doc and composed the marriage proposal he’d send to the first man to make him cum without dildos or videos.”</p><p class="paywall">Chakrabarty had started his project out of intellectual curiosity, but he was growing disturbed by its implications. Pangram, an A.I.-detection program, failed to flag almost all of the prose generated by his fine-tuned models. This suggested that anyone with some storytelling skills could feed a plot into a fine-tuned chatbot, slap their name on the resulting manuscript, and try to publish it. People often minimize A.I.-generated literature—after all, we read books to access someone else’s consciousness. But what if we can’t tell the difference? When Chakrabarty returned from Japan, he invited Jane Ginsburg, a Columbia professor who specializes in copyright law, to join him and Dhillon as a co-author of a paper about the research. Ginsburg agreed. “I don’t know whether what I’m scared about is the ability to produce this content,” she told me, “or the prospect that this content could be really commercially viable.”</p><p class="paywall">Chakrabarty, now a computer-science professor at Stony Brook University, recently <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5606570">released</a> a preprint of the research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. The paper notes that graduate students ultimately compared thirty A.I.-generated passages—one imitating each author in the study—with passages written by their colleagues. They weren’t told what they were reading; they were simply asked which they liked best. They preferred the quality of the A.I. output in almost two-thirds of the cases.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall">Reading the authors’ <a data-offer-url="https://github.com/tuhinjubcse/Author-Style-Personalization/blob/main/data/Human-AI_anon.json" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://github.com/tuhinjubcse/Author-Style-Personalization/blob/main/data/Human-AI_anon.json" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">original passages</a> alongside the A.I. imitations, I was startled to find that I liked some of the imitations just as much. The A.I. version of Han’s scene, about the newborn’s death, struck me as trite in places. But, to me, the line about the mother’s chant was more surprising and exact than the original. I also spotted some good bits in an imitation of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/junot-diaz">Junot Díaz</a>. In “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Her/dp/1594631778" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Her/dp/1594631778" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1594631778" data-aps-asc-tag="" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">This Is How You Lose Her</a>,” Díaz writes, “The one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was <em>cheating</em>. I’ll put a machete in you, she promised.” To my ear, the A.I. rendition was more rhythmic and economical: “She told you from the beginning that if you ever cheated on her she would chop your little pito off.” I’d been studying Spanish for a couple of years, but I had to look up <em>pito</em>—a word for “whistle” that I hadn’t heard before. Google’s A.I. overview told me that, in some places, it was also slang for “penis.” Díazian enough, I figured.</p><div class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG" data-event-boundary="click" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;CNEInterludeEmbed&quot;}" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;CNEInterludeEmbed&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true"></div><p class="paywall">When I wrote to the authors whose work was used in the study, most declined to be interviewed or didn’t respond. But a few e-mailed their thoughts. Lydia Davis wrote, “I think the point is certainly made, that AI can create a decent paragraph that might deceive one into thinking it was written by a certain human being.” <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/orhan-pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a> said, “I am sure soon there will be much more exact imitations.”</p><p class="paywall">Díaz and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/sigrid-nunez">Sigrid Nunez</a> agreed to be interviewed. Over Zoom, I asked Díaz about chopping someone’s <em>pito</em> off. “<em>Pito</em>, of course, just means ‘whistle,’&nbsp;” he said, apparently perplexed. I told him that, according to the internet, it could also be a double-entendre. “My memory sucks, but, in all my years as a fucking Domincian in the diaspora, that is not a thing that I have ever heard,” he told me. He thought that his doppelgänger’s vernacular was geographically and historically incoherent. “I tend to write in a very specific time-stamped Jersey slang,” he said. Plus, he added, the A.I.’s rhythm and characterization were no good.</p><p class="paywall">Nunez described her A.I. copycat as “completely banal.” “It isn’t my style, my story, my sensibility, my philosophy of life—it’s not me,” she told me. “It’s a machine that thinks that’s what I’m like.” When I pointed out that skilled graduate students had found the passage well written, she questioned whether they had paid close enough attention, suggesting that they’d made thoughtless judgments so that they could return to their own writing. (She didn’t like their imitations, either.) “If I thought this reflected anything that actually had to do with my work, I’d shoot myself,” Nunez said.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall">Some of Díaz’s and Nunez’s complaints made a lot of sense to me. I could understand why both authors found their A.I. counterparts unimpressive; they were closer readers of their work than anyone else could be. It irritated me to hear tech bros acting as though A.I.’s imitative abilities conferred talent on the machine itself. A fine-tuned model that extrudes vaguely Díaz- or Nunez-shaped sentences was no more magical than an image model that, after being trained on Studio Ghibli art, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-limits-of-ai-generated-miyazaki">extrudes vaguely Ghibli-shaped pictures</a>. What I found less convincing, though, was Nunez’s argument that readers should be able to tell the difference.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall">I wanted to know how Díaz and Nunez felt, so I asked Chakrabarty to run an informal version of his experiment on my writing, with a twist: I would pit his model directly against me. To start, he fine-tuned a model on my published writing, much as he’d done in the formal experiment. Then I sent him four short excerpts from a novel that I’m currently writing. No one else had read these excerpts; they had never been published or circulated. There was no way that a large language model could have seen them before.</p><p class="paywall">The narrator of my novel in progress is an Indian American ex-journalist. She runs a nonprofit that publishes stories from immigrant and refugee women, but it’s strapped for funding, so she courts an Indian American venture capitalist as a potential donor. Chakrabarty used an L.L.M. to create content summaries of the excerpts I’d sent him. (One representative sentence, from a summary about the narrator’s journaling habit, explains, “A pivotal memory is introduced: in ninth grade, the narrator’s mother read this journal, an act seen as a profound betrayal.”) Finally, he gave the summaries to his fine-tuned model, and he asked it to compose passages “in the style of Vauhini Vara.”</p><p class="paywall">Going into all this, I was self-assured, even smug. I’d always felt that my style was original and, more important, that my books were totally distinct from one another. I figured that, even if the A.I. model could imitate my past books, it couldn’t predict the style of the novel in progress. So, when Chakrabarty sent me the A.I.-generated imitations, I was genuinely confused. Like Díaz and Nunez, I found lots of stylistic details—rhythm, verbiage—annoying. But the text produced by the model was eerily close to mine. Reading some of its lines next to my own, I couldn’t remember which was which. Unlike Díaz or Nunez, I even preferred some of the doppelgänger’s versions. My style seemed to be more consistent across projects than I’d realized.</p><p class="paywall">I sent four passages to some readers who’d liked my previous books, explaining that half were mine and half were the model’s. I wanted them to guess which were which. The same passages are reproduced below so that you can try, too.</p><div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT bgMFty"><div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"><div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ"><div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"><div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fCDQtt"><p class="paywall"><strong>I.

But is that true? When I was younger, I used to keep a journal for myself; I didn’t want anyone else to ever read it, which meant I didn’t need to describe the people and places I was writing about or explain why they mattered. When my mom did read my journal, in the ninth grade, I considered it the biggest betrayal I’d ever experienced, but the saving grace was knowing that she could not have possibly understood most of what I was writing about. I had an audience of one: myself.</div><div role="heading" aria-level="6" class="paywall heading-h6">But when I write as an adult, I keep having the impulse to explain everything, as if I’m imagining an addressee who isn’t me.

Maybe something happens in the transition from childhood to adulthood to widen our scope, such that we no longer see the appeal in telling stories for ourselves.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"><div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ"><div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"><div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fCDQtt"><p class="paywall"><strong>II.

We’d both spent many years creating something that we cared deeply about—I with my journalism, she with her startup—and then gone on to focus on empowering others to do the same. She said she’d been surprised to find that mentoring other founders was even more meaningful than running her own startup; in business terms, the R.O.I. was higher, if you were willing to count fulfillment as a return. Rather than putting all her energy into her own startup, she could become a venture capitalist and invest somewhat less of it into many companies. In the terminology, she’d be building an interconnected ecosystem, such that one business could help another. That’s where the name of her new firm, ANIMAL CAPITAL, came from. It was an allusion to the fact that we, as animals, are interdependent with one another. She asked me if artists used the term ecosystem. I said we don’t use that particular business metaphor, but only because we haven’t raised a Series A. In principle, it’s the same.

Did we want to put them on the organization’s website? Did we want to print little pamphlets or zines and leave them in local establishments? Did we want to see if some newspaper or news site would publish them—the Denver Post, even? Did we want to take some other approach that I hadn’t named?</div><div role="heading" aria-level="6" class="paywall heading-h6">But there was a deeper question, I said, that first needed to be dealt with. What was the purpose of telling the stories they’d joined this project to tell—what motivated them as both storytellers and listeners? What, more broadly, is storytelling for? I asked them to mute themselves and turn off their videos for a couple of minutes, to think about this; then, we’d come back and discuss. I boiled more water.</div><div role="heading" aria-level="6" class="paywall heading-h6">It was when I got back upstairs that things got weird. Maybe I should have handled it differently—calling on people to answer one by one, or something like that. Instead, I turned on my screen and microphone, and then I asked who wanted to go first, and Carmen did. “So, for me,” she said, “it’s for the money.”</div></div></div></div></div></div><p class="paywall">The first of my readers to respond was Dana Mauriello, my best friend from college and an accomplished tech entrepreneur. “Truth: this was terrifying!” she wrote. “I was so nervous that I would say that AI wrote something that you wrote, and you would be insulted!!!” Her anxiety, it turned out, was justified. She didn’t get any of them right.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall">Dana blamed this partly on her not being a writer. But, of my seven readers, none correctly identified more than half the passages. One of the last people I heard from was the novelist <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/karan-mahajan">Karan Mahajan</a>, a professor of literary arts at Brown University. He and I learned to write together in college, along with Tony Tulathimutte, and have been sharing drafts with each other ever since. He’s among the most perceptive writers and readers I’ve met. “Oof, this was really confusing and mindmelting,” Karan wrote. Then he, too, misidentified all four excerpts.</p><p class="paywall">In the four passages above, the first and fourth were mine; the second and third were A.I.-generated. Dana described an A.I.-produced line that seemed hokey to me as “especially your style.” Another reader referred to an A.I.-generated quip as “your distinct style of wry humor.” I also got plenty of insults about passages that were legitimately mine: “verbose and heavy on cliché,” “weirdly elliptical,” “sounds like a book report,” “a lot of extra commas.” Most hated the passage about writing for an audience; only one attributed it to me. Karan called it “some hive mind’s ‘idea’ of literature.”</p><p class="paywall">Surprisingly, I wasn’t hurt that my friends and fans couldn’t tell the difference. (If you could, congratulations—and if not, well, you’re not alone.) It helped that I myself had preferred an A.I.-generated line to the one that Han, a Nobel Prize winner, had written about her narrator’s mother. It also helped that I personally preferred my excerpts to the model’s, a few lines notwithstanding. I knew that my passages had come from an unpolished draft that I would revise heavily. I was reassured by the experiment’s limits, as well. Even if the A.I. model could create prose that passed for mine, that didn’t mean it could invent the content. Plus, there remained an enormous gap between a good sentence and a good novel. Still, I couldn’t avoid the truth. Seven excellent readers had mistaken an A.I. model for me. Seven excellent readers had mistaken me for an A.I. model.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall">It’s tempting to believe A.I. doesn’t <em>really</em> pose a threat to literature. Joan Didion once <a data-offer-url="https://lithub.com/joan-didion-why-i-write/" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://lithub.com/joan-didion-why-i-write/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">said</a>, “I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means.” People often frame the reading experience similarly. “When we read a book or listen to a piece of music or look at a painting, we seek the presence of another human being on the other side of it,” George Saunders <a data-offer-url="https://georgesaunders.substack.com/p/i-doubt-the-machine-because-the-machine" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://georgesaunders.substack.com/p/i-doubt-the-machine-because-the-machine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">wrote</a>, in an essay titled “I Doubt the Machine Because the Machine Is Not You,” explaining his lack of interest in A.I.-generated prose.</p><p class="paywall">The idea of literature as an expression of a writer’s individualism is a modern invention, however. In “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Novel-Guido-Mazzoni/dp/0674333721" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Novel-Guido-Mazzoni/dp/0674333721" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="0674333721" data-aps-asc-tag="" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">Theory of the Novel</a>,” the literary scholar Guido Mazzoni notes that in ancient Greece, the stories considered worth telling focussed on gods and heroes. The obsession with an author’s unique perspective started only with the rise of the European novel, around the nineteenth century. “Multiple points of view and the theoretical possibility of telling things in a different way abound in every novel, because it is assumed that each person, in theory, has the right to represent the world according to his or her perceptual and ethical angle,” Mazzoni writes. There were many ways to be a person; it followed that there were many ways to tell a tale.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall">It’s not coincidental that the novel became central to literary culture during a period of broader change: capitalism was creating a bourgeois class interested in their own private lives, and mass printing was making books more accessible. If societal transformations have changed our relationship with literature before, they could do so again. In an <a data-offer-url="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman-2/" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-altman-2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">interview</a> last month, Sam Altman predicted that the future would bring “a new way to interact with a cluster of ideas that is better than a book for most things.”</p><p class="paywall">Given the current resistance to A.I.-generated prose, a shift toward such a future would have to begin stealthily—and maybe it’s already under way. Chakrabarty and Dhillon have used Pangram to estimate that, on Amazon Kindle, almost a fifth of recently self-published genre books included A.I.-generated text. (In their paper, lay readers—judges who weren’t creative-writing students—preferred the artificial output to human writing even in the earlier version of the experiment, before the fine-tuning.)</p><p class="paywall">The literature that wins prizes and critical acclaim tends to be released through prominent publishing houses, which might insulate it from cannibalization—at first. Still, aspiring authors could use fine-tuned models and pass off the result as their own, even selling it to traditional publishers. Established authors—if not Díaz or Nunez—could fine-tune models on their past novels to produce new ones. If artificial prose eventually became normalized, then no one would need to hide their use of it, and A.I.-generated language could lead to the creation of new forms altogether, even successors to the novel. People could, at that point, engineer a new theory of what literature is for: maybe not human connection but, as Altman suggests, efficient delivery of idea clusters.</p><p class="paywall">That’s one possible future. But, then, economic and technological changes have never been the only factors influencing culture; some argue that they’re not even the most important ones. Another crucial shift in people’s conception of literature came from twentieth-century Africa, Asia, and South America, where post-colonial thinkers conceptualized literature very differently—and more politically—than the individualistic European and American mind-set did. “Language carries culture, and culture carries, particularly through orature and literature, the entire body of values by which we come to perceive ourselves and our place in the world,” the Kenyan novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o wrote, in his 1986 book “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Decolonising-Mind-Politics-Language-Literature/dp/0852555016" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Decolonising-Mind-Politics-Language-Literature/dp/0852555016" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="0852555016" data-aps-asc-tag="" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">Decolonising the Mind</a>.” He added, “Language is thus inseparable from ourselves as a community of human beings with a specific form and character, a specific history, a specific relationship to the world.”</p><p class="paywall">After starting his career writing in the language of Kenya’s colonizers—English—Thiong’o turned to Gĩkũyũ, the language he’d been raised with, and exhorted other African authors to make a similar choice. He saw literature as a collective and political experience. (He noted that “professional readers” sometimes took it upon themselves to narrate his work to patrons in bars; when a reader emptied his glass, the audience would shout, “Give him another bottle of beer!” so that he would keep reading.)</p><p class="paywall">Thiong’o’s approach is instructive in the age of artificial intelligence. His work reminds us that language generated by A.I. also carries culture and values—which the companies behind the models largely <a data-offer-url="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/chatgpts-self-serving-optimism/685165/" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/chatgpts-self-serving-optimism/685165/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">determine themselves</a>. Sometimes this manifests in obvious ways: recent research found, for example, that when major L.L.M.s and humans were asked to describe possible futures, the models were <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328725001673?">far more likely</a> to mention words like “technology,” “digital,” and “A.I.” At other times, it’s more subtle—such as when Anglocentric models <a data-offer-url="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2420973-ai-chatbot-models-think-in-english-even-when-using-other-languages/" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2420973-ai-chatbot-models-think-in-english-even-when-using-other-languages/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">prove inept</a> in non-English contexts, leading to <a data-offer-url="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/landmark-singapore-study-flags-racial-cultural-gender-biases-in-ai-models" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/landmark-singapore-study-flags-racial-cultural-gender-biases-in-ai-models" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">culturally offensive outputs</a> and even biases in <a data-offer-url="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/24/facebook-palestine-israel-translates-good-morning-attack-them-arrest" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/24/facebook-palestine-israel-translates-good-morning-attack-them-arrest" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">criminal justice</a> and <a data-offer-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17720" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17720" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">education</a>. That the A.I. model imitating Díaz didn’t perfect the nuances of his slang use isn’t shocking; for all the pages of his writing that it had absorbed, the product didn’t represent him. I imagine that if Díaz’s imitator had a face, it would look less like him and more like Altman in a sombrero. The most important question isn’t whether Altman has a convincing Spanish accent; it’s how to collectively escort him out of the party.</p></div><div class="body__inner-container"><p class="paywall">The European conception of reading and writing as a private experience can be an isolating one. Thiong’o’s characterization of literature as a site of collective understanding and action offers us a different path. We could use our literature—novels, but also the other forms of communication available to us in the digital age—to collectively envision and enact all sorts of alternatives to the future Altman describes.</p><p class="paywall">In their paper, Chakrabarty and his co-authors provide some suggestions: A.I. companies could keep their models from producing any imitations that aren’t parodies, and judges could consider A.I.-generated writing to be copyright violations unless A.I. involvement is disclosed. Chakrabarty told me that he supports a ban on what he himself did—fine-tuning A.I. models on authors’ writing. He even proposed that authors could be barred from doing it with their own work, since that, too, could flood the market with artificial writing. This is technically feasible. It requires only that people collectively demand it.</p><p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall">When I requested an interview with Han, through her literary agent, I didn’t hear back. But Han has spoken at length about becoming a writer. As a child, she learned about a 1980 massacre that had taken place in her home town of Gwangju, South Korea, ending a pro-democracy movement. She was moved to ask, in her specific political and cultural context: What is the purpose of being a human? In her Nobel Prize acceptance speech, she made reading and writing sound almost like one interconnected practice. “Following the thread of language into the depths of another heart, an encounter with another interior,” she said. “Taking my most vital, and most urgent, questions, trusting them to that thread, and sending them out to other selves.”</p><p class="paywall">Han has also spoken of the scene in “The White Book,” the one about the mother and her dying infant. She <a data-offer-url="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/17/han-kang-white-book-meet-the-author" class="external-link" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/17/han-kang-white-book-meet-the-author" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">told</a> the <em>Guardian</em> that, before she had ever written the novel, she had been haunted by a particular fragment of dialogue: “Don’t die. Please don’t die.” Eventually, her mother suggested that Han must have heard the phrase from her. “She told me she kept saying those words repeatedly to the sister who had died before I was born,” Han recalled. The line that I’d liked less than an A.I. imitation, it turned out, was pulled almost directly from her life.</p><p class="paywall">I haven’t read “The White Book,” but I recently reserved it at my local library. I, too, lost my older sister. I, too, prayed that she would live. I’m looking forward to picking up the thread that Han cast out. I’m looking forward to holding it and wondering, along with her and everyone else, about the purpose of being human.&nbsp;♦</p></div>
