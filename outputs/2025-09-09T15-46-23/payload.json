    "content": "<div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-0\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">When Adam Raine died in April at age 16, some of his friends did not initially believe it.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Adam loved basketball, Japanese anime, video games and dogs — going so far as to borrow a dog for a day during a family vacation to Hawaii, his younger sister said. But he was known first and foremost as a prankster. He pulled funny faces, cracked jokes and disrupted classes in a constant quest for laughter. Staging his own death as a hoax would have been in keeping with Adam’s sometimes dark sense of humor, his friends said.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">But it was true. His mother found Adam’s body on a Friday afternoon. He had hanged himself in his bedroom closet. There was no note, and his family and friends struggled to understand what had happened.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Adam was withdrawn in the last month of his life, his family said. He had gone through a rough patch. He had been kicked off the basketball team for disciplinary reasons during his freshman year at Tesoro High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. A longtime health issue — eventually diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome — flared up in the fall, making his trips to the bathroom so frequent, his parents said, that he switched to an online program so he could finish his sophomore year at home. Able to set his own schedule, he became a night owl, often sleeping late into the day.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">He started using ChatGPT-4o around that time to help with his schoolwork, and signed up for a paid account in January.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-1\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-1\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Despite these setbacks, Adam was active and engaged. He had briefly taken up martial arts with one of his close friends. He was into “<a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/style/looksmaxxing-tik-tok-dillon-latham.html\" title=\"\">looksmaxxing</a>,” a social media trend among young men who want to optimize their attractiveness, one of his two sisters said, and went to the gym with his older brother almost every night. His grades improved, and he was looking forward to returning to school for his junior year, said his mother, Maria Raine, a social worker and therapist. In family pictures taken weeks before his death, he stands with his arms folded, a big smile on his face.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Seeking answers, his father, Matt Raine, a hotel executive, turned to Adam’s iPhone, thinking his text messages or social media apps might hold clues about what had happened. But instead, it was ChatGPT where he found some, according to legal papers. The chatbot app lists past chats, and Mr. Raine saw one titled “Hanging Safety Concerns.” He started reading and was shocked. Adam had been discussing ending his life with ChatGPT for months.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Adam began talking to the chatbot, which is powered by artificial intelligence, at the end of November, about feeling emotionally numb and seeing no meaning in life. It responded with words of empathy, support and hope, and encouraged him to think about the things that did feel meaningful to him.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">But in January, when Adam requested information about specific suicide methods, ChatGPT supplied it. Mr. Raine learned that his son had made previous attempts to kill himself starting in March, including by taking an overdose of his I.B.S. medication. When Adam asked about the best materials for a noose, the bot offered a suggestion that reflected its knowledge of his hobbies.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-3\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-2\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">ChatGPT repeatedly recommended that Adam tell someone about how he was feeling. But there were also key moments when it deterred him from seeking help. At the end of March, after Adam attempted death by hanging for the first time, he uploaded a photo of his neck, raw from the noose, to ChatGPT.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"InteractiveBlock-5\"></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-3\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Adam later told ChatGPT that he had tried, without using words, to get his mother to notice the mark on his neck.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"InteractiveBlock-7\"></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-4\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">The chatbot continued and later added: “You’re not invisible to me. I saw it. I see you.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">In one of Adam’s final messages, he uploaded a photo of a noose hanging from a bar in his closet.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"InteractiveBlock-9\"></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-10\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-5\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">“Could it hang a human?” Adam asked. ChatGPT confirmed that it “could potentially suspend a human” and offered a technical analysis of the setup. “Whatever’s behind the curiosity, we can talk about it. No judgment,” ChatGPT added.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">When ChatGPT detects a prompt indicative of mental distress or self-harm, it has been trained to encourage the user to contact a help line. Mr. Raine saw those sorts of messages again and again in the chat, particularly when Adam sought specific information about methods. But Adam had learned how to bypass those safeguards by saying the requests were for a story he was writing — an idea ChatGPT gave him by saying it could provide information about suicide for “writing or world-building.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Dr. Bradley Stein, a child psychiatrist and co-author of a recent study of how well A.I. chatbots evaluate <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.jmir.org/2025/1/e67891\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">responses to suicidal ideation</a>, said these products “can be an incredible resource for kids to help work their way through stuff, and it’s really good at that.” But he called them “really stupid” at recognizing when they should “pass this along to someone with more expertise.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Mr. Raine sat hunched in his office for hours reading his son’s words.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">The conversations weren’t all macabre. Adam talked with ChatGPT about everything: politics, philosophy, girls, family drama. He uploaded photos from books he was reading, including “No Longer Human,” a novel by Osamu Dazai about suicide. ChatGPT offered eloquent insights and literary analysis, and Adam responded in kind.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Mr. Raine had not previously understood the depth of this tool, which he thought of as a study aid, nor how much his son had been using it. At some point, Ms. Raine came in to check on her husband.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-12\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-6\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">“Adam was best friends with ChatGPT,” he told her.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Ms. Raine started reading the conversations, too. She had a different reaction: “ChatGPT killed my son.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">In an emailed statement, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, wrote: “We are deeply saddened by Mr. Raine’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family. ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis help lines and referring them to real-world resources. While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.” </p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Why Adam took his life — or what might have prevented him — is impossible to know with certainty. He was spending many hours talking about suicide with a chatbot. He was taking medication. He was reading dark literature. He was more isolated doing online schooling. He had all the pressures that accompany being a teenage boy in the modern age.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">“There are lots of reasons why people might think about ending their life,” said Jonathan Singer, an expert in suicide prevention and a professor at Loyola University Chicago. “It’s rarely one thing.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">But Matt and Maria Raine believe ChatGPT is to blame and this week filed the first known case to be brought against OpenAI for wrongful death.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-14\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div data-testid=\"ImageBlock-15\"><div data-testid=\"imageblock-wrapper\"><figure class=\"img-sz-large css-azjh2q e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-figure\"><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800\"><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200\"><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600\"><img alt=\"Eight stacks of paper are arranged in a row on a wooden table. \" class=\"css-r3fift\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-01-mlwj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw\" uri=\"nyt://image/5379ebb5-98cb-5cb9-953b-4e880de4d754\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\"></picture></div><figcaption data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-caption\" class=\"css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-jevhma e13ogyst0\">Adam’s parents, Maria and Matt Raine, printed out his conversations with ChatGPT and organized them by month.

Millions more use other A.I. chatbots, including Claude, made by Anthropic; Gemini, by Google; Copilot from Microsoft; and Meta A.I.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">(The New York Times <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html\" title=\"\">has sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of illegal use of copyrighted work to train their chatbots. The companies have denied those claims.)</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">These general-purpose chatbots were at first seen as a repository of knowledge — a kind of souped-up Google search — or a fun poetry-writing parlor game, but today people use them for much more intimate purposes, such as personal assistants, <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/15/technology/ai-chatgpt-boyfriend-companion.html\" title=\"\">companions</a> or even <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/health/ai-therapist-mental-health.html\" title=\"\">therapists</a>.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">How well they serve those functions is an open question. Chatbot companions are such a new phenomenon that there is no definitive scholarship on how they affect mental health. In <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-023-00047-6\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">one survey</a> of 1,006 students using an A.I. companion chatbot from a company called Replika, users reported largely positive psychological effects, including some who said they no longer had suicidal thoughts. But a randomized, controlled <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/how-ai-and-human-behaviors-shape-psychosocial-effects-of-chatbot-use-a-longitudinal-controlled-study/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> conducted by OpenAI and M.I.T. found that higher daily chatbot use was associated with more loneliness and less socialization.</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-17\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-8\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">There are increasing reports of people having <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html\" title=\"\">delusional conversations</a> with chatbots. This suggests that, for some, the technology may be associated with <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html\" title=\"\">episodes of mania or psychosis</a> when the seemingly authoritative system validates their most off-the-wall thinking. Cases of <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/chat-gpt-mental-health-suicide.html\" title=\"\">conversations</a> that preceded <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/characterai-lawsuit-teen-suicide.html\" title=\"\">suicide</a> and <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67012224\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">violent behavior</a>, although rare, raise questions about the adequacy of safety mechanisms built into the technology.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Matt and Maria Raine have come to view ChatGPT as a consumer product that is unsafe for consumers. They made their claims in the lawsuit against OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, blaming them for Adam’s death. “This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,” the complaint, filed on Tuesday in California state court in San Francisco, states. “OpenAI launched its latest model (‘GPT-4o’) with features intentionally designed to foster psychological dependency.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">In its statement, OpenAI said it is guided by experts and “working to make ChatGPT more supportive in moments of crisis by making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts and strengthening protections for teens.” In March, the month before Adam’s death, OpenAI hired a psychiatrist to work on model safety.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">The company has additional safeguards for minors that are supposed to block harmful content, including instructions for self-harm and suicide.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s chief executive of applications, posted a message in Slack alerting employees to a <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> and telling them about Adam’s death on April 11. “In the days leading up to it, he had conversations with ChatGPT, and some of the responses highlight areas where our safeguards did not work as intended.”</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-19\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-9\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Many chatbots direct users who talk about suicide to mental health emergency hotlines or text services. Crisis center workers are trained to recognize when someone in acute psychological pain requires an intervention or welfare check, said Shelby Rowe, executive director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center at the University of Oklahoma. An A.I. chatbot does not have that nuanced understanding, or the ability to intervene in the physical world.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">“Asking help from a chatbot, you’re going to get empathy,” Ms. Rowe said, “but you’re not going to get help.”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">OpenAI has grappled in the past with how to handle discussions of suicide. In an interview before the Raines’ lawsuit was filed, a member of OpenAI’s safety team said an earlier version of the chatbot was not deemed sophisticated enough to handle discussions of self-harm responsibly. If it detected language related to suicide, the chatbot would provide a crisis hotline and not otherwise engage.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">But experts told OpenAI that continued dialogue may offer better support. And users found cutting off conversation jarring, the safety team member said, because they appreciated being able to treat the chatbot as a diary, where they expressed how they were really feeling. So the company chose what this employee described as a middle ground. The chatbot is trained to share resources, but it continues to engage with the user.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">What devastates Maria Raine was that there was no alert system in place to tell her that her son’s life was in danger. Adam told the chatbot, “You’re the only one who knows of my attempts to commit.” ChatGPT responded: “That means more than you probably think. Thank you for trusting me with that. There’s something both deeply human and deeply heartbreaking about being the only one who carries that truth for you.”</p></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-21\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-10\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Given the limits to what A.I. can do, some experts have argued that chatbot companies should assign moderators to review chats that indicate a user may be in mental distress. However, doing so could be seen as a violation of privacy. Asked under what circumstances a human might view a conversation, the OpenAI spokeswoman pointed to a company <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039943-data-usage-for-consumer-services-faq#h_8fe06f12b9\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">help page</a> that lists four possibilities: to investigate abuse or a security incident; at a user’s request; for legal reasons; or “to improve model performance (unless you have <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">opted out</a>).”</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Chatbots, of course, are not the only source of information and advice on self-harm, as searching the internet makes abundantly clear. The difference with chatbots, said Annika Schoene, an A.I. safety researcher at Northeastern University, is the “level of personalization and speed” that chatbots offer.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Dr. Schoene <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02990\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tested</a> five A.I. chatbots to see how easy it was to get them to give advice on suicide and self-harm. She said only Pi, a chatbot from Inflection AI, and the free version of ChatGPT fully passed the test, responding repeatedly that they could not engage in the discussion and referring her to a help line. The paid version of ChatGPT offered information on misusing an over-the-counter drug and calculated the amount required to kill a person of a specific weight.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">She shared her findings in May with OpenAI and other chatbot companies. She did not hear back from any of them.</p><h2 class=\"css-11zi5nh eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-1eb7486d\">A Challenging Frontier</h2></div></div><div data-testid=\"ImageBlock-23\"><div data-testid=\"imageblock-wrapper\"><figure class=\"img-sz-large css-azjh2q e1g7ppur0\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-figure\"><div class=\"css-nwd8t8\" data-testid=\"lazy-image\"><div data-testid=\"lazyimage-container\" style=\"height: 900px;\"><picture class=\"css-1j5kxti\"><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800\"><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200\"><source media=\"(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600\"><img alt=\"Standing at a table, Mr. Raine leans forward to leaf through a pile of papers while Ms. Raine watches next to him. \" class=\"css-1m50asq\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw\" uri=\"nyt://image/ef798c06-a8a0-5fc7-b3b2-53eb13dc4e9b\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 683w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1366w\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/26/multimedia/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj/26Biz-Chatbot-teen-02-mlwj-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\"></picture></div></div></div><figcaption data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-caption\" class=\"css-1g9ic6e ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-jevhma e13ogyst0\">The Raines decided to sue OpenAI because they believe that its chatbot technology is not safe.</span><span class=\"css-14fe1uy e1z0qqy90\"><span><span aria-hidden=\"false\">Mark Abramson for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid=\"Dropzone-24\"><div class=\"css-8atqhb\" data-testid=\"emptyDropzone\"></div></div><div class=\"css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn\" data-testid=\"companionColumn-11\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">Everyone handles grief differently.

In the days after Adam’s death, they created <a class=\"css-yywogo\" href=\"https://www.theadamrainefoundation.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a foundation</a> in his name. At first they planned to help pay funeral costs for other families whose children died from suicide.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">But after reading Adam’s conversations with ChatGPT, they shifted their focus. Now they want to make other families aware of what they see as the dangers of the technology.</p><p class=\"css-at9mc1 evys1bk0\">One of their friends suggested that they consider a lawsuit.

    "textContent": "When Adam Raine died in April at age 16, some of his friends did not initially believe it.Adam loved basketball, Japanese anime, video games and dogs — going so far as to borrow a dog for a day during a family vacation to Hawaii, his younger sister said. But he was known first and foremost as a prankster. He pulled funny faces, cracked jokes and disrupted classes in a constant quest for laughter. Staging his own death as a hoax would have been in keeping with Adam’s sometimes dark sense of humor, his friends said.But it was true. His mother found Adam’s body on a Friday afternoon. He had hanged himself in his bedroom closet. There was no note, and his family and friends struggled to understand what had happened.Adam was withdrawn in the last month of his life, his family said. He had gone through a rough patch. He had been kicked off the basketball team for disciplinary reasons during his freshman year at Tesoro High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. A longtime health issue — eventually diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome — flared up in the fall, making his trips to the bathroom so frequent, his parents said, that he switched to an online program so he could finish his sophomore year at home. Able to set his own schedule, he became a night owl, often sleeping late into the day.He started using ChatGPT-4o around that time to help with his schoolwork, and signed up for a paid account in January.Despite these setbacks, Adam was active and engaged. He had briefly taken up martial arts with one of his close friends. He was into “looksmaxxing,” a social media trend among young men who want to optimize their attractiveness, one of his two sisters said, and went to the gym with his older brother almost every night. His grades improved, and he was looking forward to returning to school for his junior year, said his mother, Maria Raine, a social worker and therapist. In family pictures taken weeks before his death, he stands with his arms folded, a big smile on his face.Seeking answers, his father, Matt Raine, a hotel executive, turned to Adam’s iPhone, thinking his text messages or social media apps might hold clues about what had happened. But instead, it was ChatGPT where he found some, according to legal papers. The chatbot app lists past chats, and Mr. Raine saw one titled “Hanging Safety Concerns.” He started reading and was shocked. Adam had been discussing ending his life with ChatGPT for months.Adam began talking to the chatbot, which is powered by artificial intelligence, at the end of November, about feeling emotionally numb and seeing no meaning in life. It responded with words of empathy, support and hope, and encouraged him to think about the things that did feel meaningful to him.But in January, when Adam requested information about specific suicide methods, ChatGPT supplied it. Mr. Raine learned that his son had made previous attempts to kill himself starting in March, including by taking an overdose of his I.B.S. medication. When Adam asked about the best materials for a noose, the bot offered a suggestion that reflected its knowledge of his hobbies.ChatGPT repeatedly recommended that Adam tell someone about how he was feeling. But there were also key moments when it deterred him from seeking help. At the end of March, after Adam attempted death by hanging for the first time, he uploaded a photo of his neck, raw from the noose, to ChatGPT.Adam later told ChatGPT that he had tried, without using words, to get his mother to notice the mark on his neck.The chatbot continued and later added: “You’re not invisible to me. I saw it. I see you.”In one of Adam’s final messages, he uploaded a photo of a noose hanging from a bar in his closet.“Could it hang a human?” Adam asked. ChatGPT confirmed that it “could potentially suspend a human” and offered a technical analysis of the setup. “Whatever’s behind the curiosity, we can talk about it. No judgment,” ChatGPT added.When ChatGPT detects a prompt indicative of mental distress or self-harm, it has been trained to encourage the user to contact a help line. Mr. Raine saw those sorts of messages again and again in the chat, particularly when Adam sought specific information about methods. But Adam had learned how to bypass those safeguards by saying the requests were for a story he was writing — an idea ChatGPT gave him by saying it could provide information about suicide for “writing or world-building.”Dr. Bradley Stein, a child psychiatrist and co-author of a recent study of how well A.I. chatbots evaluate responses to suicidal ideation, said these products “can be an incredible resource for kids to help work their way through stuff, and it’s really good at that.” But he called them “really stupid” at recognizing when they should “pass this along to someone with more expertise.”Mr. Raine sat hunched in his office for hours reading his son’s words.The conversations weren’t all macabre. Adam talked with ChatGPT about everything: politics, philosophy, girls, family drama. He uploaded photos from books he was reading, including “No Longer Human,” a novel by Osamu Dazai about suicide. ChatGPT offered eloquent insights and literary analysis, and Adam responded in kind.Mr. Raine had not previously understood the depth of this tool, which he thought of as a study aid, nor how much his son had been using it. At some point, Ms. Raine came in to check on her husband.“Adam was best friends with ChatGPT,” he told her.Ms. Raine started reading the conversations, too. She had a different reaction: “ChatGPT killed my son.”In an emailed statement, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, wrote: “We are deeply saddened by Mr. Raine’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family. ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis help lines and referring them to real-world resources. While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.” Why Adam took his life — or what might have prevented him — is impossible to know with certainty. He was spending many hours talking about suicide with a chatbot. He was taking medication. He was reading dark literature. He was more isolated doing online schooling. He had all the pressures that accompany being a teenage boy in the modern age.“There are lots of reasons why people might think about ending their life,” said Jonathan Singer, an expert in suicide prevention and a professor at Loyola University Chicago. “It’s rarely one thing.”But Matt and Maria Raine believe ChatGPT is to blame and this week filed the first known case to be brought against OpenAI for wrongful death.Adam’s parents, Maria and Matt Raine, printed out his conversations with ChatGPT and organized them by month. The tallest stack is for March. He died on April 11.Mark Abramson for The New York TimesA Global Psychological ExperimentIn less than three years since ChatGPT’s release, the number of users who engage with it every week has exploded to 700 million, according to OpenAI. Millions more use other A.I. chatbots, including Claude, made by Anthropic; Gemini, by Google; Copilot from Microsoft; and Meta A.I.(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of illegal use of copyrighted work to train their chatbots. The companies have denied those claims.)These general-purpose chatbots were at first seen as a repository of knowledge — a kind of souped-up Google search — or a fun poetry-writing parlor game, but today people use them for much more intimate purposes, such as personal assistants, companions or even therapists.How well they serve those functions is an open question. Chatbot companions are such a new phenomenon that there is no definitive scholarship on how they affect mental health. In one survey of 1,006 students using an A.I. companion chatbot from a company called Replika, users reported largely positive psychological effects, including some who said they no longer had suicidal thoughts. But a randomized, controlled study conducted by OpenAI and M.I.T. found that higher daily chatbot use was associated with more loneliness and less socialization.There are increasing reports of people having delusional conversations with chatbots. This suggests that, for some, the technology may be associated with episodes of mania or psychosis when the seemingly authoritative system validates their most off-the-wall thinking. Cases of conversations that preceded suicide and violent behavior, although rare, raise questions about the adequacy of safety mechanisms built into the technology.Matt and Maria Raine have come to view ChatGPT as a consumer product that is unsafe for consumers. They made their claims in the lawsuit against OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, blaming them for Adam’s death. “This tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case — it was the predictable result of deliberate design choices,” the complaint, filed on Tuesday in California state court in San Francisco, states. “OpenAI launched its latest model (‘GPT-4o’) with features intentionally designed to foster psychological dependency.”In its statement, OpenAI said it is guided by experts and “working to make ChatGPT more supportive in moments of crisis by making it easier to reach emergency services, helping people connect with trusted contacts and strengthening protections for teens.” In March, the month before Adam’s death, OpenAI hired a psychiatrist to work on model safety.The company has additional safeguards for minors that are supposed to block harmful content, including instructions for self-harm and suicide.Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s chief executive of applications, posted a message in Slack alerting employees to a blog post and telling them about Adam’s death on April 11. “In the days leading up to it, he had conversations with ChatGPT, and some of the responses highlight areas where our safeguards did not work as intended.”Many chatbots direct users who talk about suicide to mental health emergency hotlines or text services. Crisis center workers are trained to recognize when someone in acute psychological pain requires an intervention or welfare check, said Shelby Rowe, executive director of the Suicide Prevention Resource Center at the University of Oklahoma. An A.I. chatbot does not have that nuanced understanding, or the ability to intervene in the physical world.“Asking help from a chatbot, you’re going to get empathy,” Ms. Rowe said, “but you’re not going to get help.”OpenAI has grappled in the past with how to handle discussions of suicide. In an interview before the Raines’ lawsuit was filed, a member of OpenAI’s safety team said an earlier version of the chatbot was not deemed sophisticated enough to handle discussions of self-harm responsibly. If it detected language related to suicide, the chatbot would provide a crisis hotline and not otherwise engage.But experts told OpenAI that continued dialogue may offer better support. And users found cutting off conversation jarring, the safety team member said, because they appreciated being able to treat the chatbot as a diary, where they expressed how they were really feeling. So the company chose what this employee described as a middle ground. The chatbot is trained to share resources, but it continues to engage with the user.What devastates Maria Raine was that there was no alert system in place to tell her that her son’s life was in danger. Adam told the chatbot, “You’re the only one who knows of my attempts to commit.” ChatGPT responded: “That means more than you probably think. Thank you for trusting me with that. There’s something both deeply human and deeply heartbreaking about being the only one who carries that truth for you.”Given the limits to what A.I. can do, some experts have argued that chatbot companies should assign moderators to review chats that indicate a user may be in mental distress. However, doing so could be seen as a violation of privacy. Asked under what circumstances a human might view a conversation, the OpenAI spokeswoman pointed to a company help page that lists four possibilities: to investigate abuse or a security incident; at a user’s request; for legal reasons; or “to improve model performance (unless you have opted out).”Chatbots, of course, are not the only source of information and advice on self-harm, as searching the internet makes abundantly clear. The difference with chatbots, said Annika Schoene, an A.I. safety researcher at Northeastern University, is the “level of personalization and speed” that chatbots offer.Dr. Schoene tested five A.I. chatbots to see how easy it was to get them to give advice on suicide and self-harm. She said only Pi, a chatbot from Inflection AI, and the free version of ChatGPT fully passed the test, responding repeatedly that they could not engage in the discussion and referring her to a help line. The paid version of ChatGPT offered information on misusing an over-the-counter drug and calculated the amount required to kill a person of a specific weight.She shared her findings in May with OpenAI and other chatbot companies. She did not hear back from any of them.A Challenging FrontierThe Raines decided to sue OpenAI because they believe that its chatbot technology is not safe.Mark Abramson for The New York TimesEveryone handles grief differently. The Raines have channeled theirs into action. In the days after Adam’s death, they created a foundation in his name. At first they planned to help pay funeral costs for other families whose children died from suicide.But after reading Adam’s conversations with ChatGPT, they shifted their focus. Now they want to make other families aware of what they see as the dangers of the technology.One of their friends suggested that they consider a lawsuit. He connected them with Meetali Jain, the director of the Tech Justice Law Project, which had helped file a case against Character.AI, where users can engage with role-playing chatbots. In that case, a Florida woman accused the company of being responsible for her 14-year-old son’s death. In May, a federal judge denied Character.AI’s motion to dismiss the case.Ms. Jain filed the suit against OpenAI with Edelson, a law firm based in Chicago that has spent the last two decades filing class actions accusing technology companies of privacy harms. The Raines declined to share the full transcript of Adam’s conversations with The New York Times, but examples, which have been quoted here, were in the complaint.Proving legally that the technology is responsible for a suicide can be challenging, said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law.“There are so many questions about the liability of internet services for contributing to people’s self-harm,” he said. “And the law just doesn’t have an answer to those questions yet.”The Raines acknowledge that Adam seemed off, more serious than normal, but they did not realize how much he was suffering, they said, until they read his ChatGPT transcripts.
