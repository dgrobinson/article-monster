# Article Bookmarklet Service

A cloud service that sends web articles to both Kindle and Zotero with a single bookmarklet click.

## Features

### Bookmarklet Service
- üîê **Works with authenticated content** - extracts articles from paywalled sites you're logged into
- üìß **Kindle integration** - sends clean HTML that Kindle converts automatically
- üìö **Zotero integration** - creates proper citations with EPUB attachments for highlighting
- üéØ **Browser-side extraction** - uses Mozilla Readability.js in your browser
- ‚ö° **Fast processing** - sends to both platforms in parallel
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe for Zotero** - uses test collections and careful API integration


## Site-Specific Extraction
All site-specific extraction rules live in the `site-configs/` directory using the FiveFilters format.
The application codebase contains no domain-specific hacks‚Äîadding support for a new site means
creating a config file, not modifying code. The directory is a git submodule tracking the
official FiveFilters configuration repository.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Gmail account (for Kindle email sending)
- Zotero account with API key
- Kindle device with email configured

### 2. Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your actual credentials
nano .env
```

Required environment variables:
```
# Bookmarklet Service
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
KINDLE_EMAIL=your-username@kindle.com
ZOTERO_USER_ID=your-numeric-user-id
ZOTERO_API_KEY=your-api-key
ZOTERO_TEST_COLLECTION=optional-collection-key

# Optional automation
CODEX_AGENT_API_URL=https://codex.example.com/v1/jobs
CODEX_AGENT_API_KEY=your-secret
CODEX_AGENT_ID=parse-triage

```

### 3. Setup Kindle

1. Go to [Amazon Manage Your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html)
2. Go to Preferences ‚Üí Personal Document Settings
3. Add your `EMAIL_USER` to the approved email list

### 4. Setup Zotero

1. Go to [Zotero API Keys](https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys)
2. Create new key with "Allow library access" and "Allow write access"
3. Copy your User ID and API key
4. Create a test collection called "Bookmarklet Test"

### 5. Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to install the bookmarklet.

### 6. Deploy to Cloud

The service is designed for DigitalOcean App Platform:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to DigitalOcean App Platform
3. Set environment variables in the dashboard
4. Deploy!

## Usage

1. Install the bookmarklet from your running service
2. Visit any article page
3. Click the bookmarklet
4. Article appears in both Kindle and Zotero!

## Architecture

```
Browser (with auth) ‚Üí Bookmarklet extracts content ‚Üí Cloud Service ‚Üí Kindle + Zotero
```

The bookmarklet runs Mozilla Readability.js in your browser to extract clean article content, then sends it to the cloud service which formats and delivers to both platforms.

## Safety

- Zotero operations only ADD items, never modify existing ones
- Uses test collections to protect your main library
- All operations are logged for debugging
- Browser-side extraction respects your authentication

## Development & Future Plans

- **Future Enhancements**: See [METADATA_ROADMAP.md](./METADATA_ROADMAP.md) for planned metadata improvements
- **Contributing**: See [CONTRIBUTING_TO_FIVEFILTERS.md](./CONTRIBUTING_TO_FIVEFILTERS.md) for site extraction rules
- **Debug System**: See [DEBUG_SYSTEM.md](./DEBUG_SYSTEM.md) for comprehensive debugging capabilities

## Troubleshooting

- Check service status at your deployed URL
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Kindle email is approved for your sender
- Test Zotero API key permissions
- Check browser console for bookmarklet errors

## Automated Codex Triage (Optional)

If `CODEX_AGENT_API_URL` is configured, every failed extraction report will trigger a POST request to your Codex automation service containing the GitHub issue number, repository name, reporter notes, and the server's Readability analysis. Use this hook to launch an agent that can reproduce the problem, diagnose it, and open a pull request. Provide `CODEX_AGENT_API_KEY` if the endpoint requires authentication, and optionally `CODEX_AGENT_ID` to select a specific agent profile.
