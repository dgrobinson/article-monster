# Contributing Back to FiveFilters

As good open source citizens using FiveFilters' extensive site configuration work, we should contribute back to help maintain and improve their 2000+ site configs.

All domain-specific extraction rules live in our `site-configs/` directory. Any tweaks for particular sites should be made there and, whenever possible, shared upstream with the FiveFilters project.

## Current Ways We Can Help

### 1. Test and Fix Site Configurations

Use our archived test cases to validate FiveFilters configs:

```bash
# Test The Atlantic config against our saved article
node test-cases/run-tests.js --site theatlantic.com --example atlantic-trump-trade-deals.html
```

### 2. Report and Fix Broken Configs

From their GitHub issues, these sites need help:
- **nytimes.com** - lazy-loaded images not working
- **quantamagazine.org** - missing pictures  
- **faz.net** - broken config
- **phoronix.com** - not working
- **tweakers.net** - pattern outdated

### 3. Create Missing Configurations

Sites we encounter that don't have FiveFilters configs yet:
- Check `ls site-configs/` for missing major news sites
- Create configs using their web interface: http://siteconfig.fivefilters.org
- Submit via GitHub pull requests

### 4. Automated Testing Contribution

**Future Project**: Create automated testing system that:
- Tests all FiveFilters configs against real articles
- Reports failures as GitHub issues
- Suggests fixes based on successful extraction patterns
